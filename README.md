Advertising Sales Prediction
Predicting product sales based on advertising spend is essential for effective marketing. This project delves into advertising analytics, using machine learning to analyze the impact of TV, radio, and newspaper channels on sales. From initial data exploration to advanced techniques like Lasso regression, this project provides insights to optimize marketing strategies for improved sales outcomes.

Overview
Explore the relationship between advertising expenditure and product sales using machine learning techniques. The project includes:

Data Exploration: Initial analysis of the dataset.

Feature Selection: Utilizing correlation to select relevant features.

Multifeature Selection: Exploring the impact of multiple features on sales.

Lasso Regression: Implementing Lasso regression for improved predictions.
